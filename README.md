# Snowflake and dbt - Quickstart

*Production-ready dbt project on Snowflake with GitHub-based workflow.*


This is my first project on Snowflake using dbt Cloud üéâ <br>
I followed the official guide [Quickstart for dbt and Snowflake](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/snowflake?step=1), an excellent starting point for getting into the world of dbt.

## Overview
- **Warehouse:** Snowflake (RAW, ANALYTICS).
- **Transformations:** dbt Cloud (Studio + Orchestration).
- **Versioning:** GitHub PR workflow.
- **Goal:** Learn to create reliable, documented, and tested analytics models.

## What this project does
- Connects **dbt Cloud** to a **Snowflake** data warehouse.
- Creates a simple data model using **staging** and **marts**.
- Demonstrates how to run, test, and version-control models with **GitHub**.

## Why I did this
dbt is an amazing tool in the data engineering field that brings software development best practices into analytics and facilitates cross-functional collaboration. As part of my continuous learning, I wanted hands-on experience with dbt. This repo documents the beginning of my journey ‚ú®

## Lessons learned and suggestions for other learners
- When learning, pay attention to every step, don‚Äôt just copy-paste!
- Save your files before running dbt. Commit often.
- GitHub is worth setting up early, even if Managed repos are easier.
- The ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù section in older tutorials is now called **Orchestration**.
